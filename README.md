# Max-Timer-Plugin
Max Timer: A timer for freelancers/teachers/anyone, runs in MaxMSP and saves a text file with the total time worked when you exit Max. 

<h2>Install:</h2>

For Max 6.1+

• Place the timer-master folder in your packages folder Documents > Max > Packages

For Max 6 and older

• Place the timer-master filder in a search path (you can select a search path from file-preferences)
• Place the timer.maxpat in patcher > extras inside the Max Folder

<h2>Use:</h2>

To enable:

Launch Max > Go to Extras > Select Timer > Check activate > Pick Directory to save files in (I made a new folder called Times in Documents) 

The timer will now start each time you launch Max

To disable:

Launch Max > Go to Extras > Select Timer > Uncheck active

Now the timer will not start when you launch Max

<h2>Todo:</h2>

Add a pause button and auto pause when max is not in focus
use screen size to determine initial size of timer (also set up for corners of screen for initialization)
Add a menu option to change the timer size manually and have this size saved as the default
Add color options (why not)

<h2>Bugs:</h2>
Issues on Windows, working on a fix
